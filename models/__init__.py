"""
This is our project package for models. They are connected to database using flask-sql alchemy
every model presents some part of our websites
their relationship was determined on our ER diagram then they were developed
their application is to handle website data in back-end
in process of app running, they will be connected to view functions and front pages via jinja2
each model(class) has their own module here
